    <p>Hot. Spicy. Crunchy. ZESTYYYY.</p>
    <p>Hailing from Buffalo, New York, this recipe was a GENERATIONAL SECRET...until now.</p>
    <p>
        These wings will KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF with their spicy and sour punch. Don't forget about that juicy meaty goodness encased in an irresistably crunchy coating! 
        Legend has it that ancient merchants discovered this recipe atop the steps of Zeus's Temple. When they tried to bring it back, their ship was 
        struck by a bolt of lightning! The ship, along with the recipe, was believed to have been lost to the great depths of the sea...never to be seen again.
